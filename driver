/*
After reviewing the performance of the restaurant, we would also want to understand the performance of our couriers. Competition is stiff because there are lots of delivery platforms.
If our couriers cannot earn basic income, they will leave to another platform.

看完了餐廳的表現，我們也想了解我們外送員的表現。畢竟送餐平台那麼多，競爭那麼激烈。如果我們的外送員都覺得無法在我們平台上賺到一定的收入，他們可能就會跑去其他的送餐平台。
為了掌握外送員的營收表現，我們需要外送員所接到的訂單和總收入。因此，希望小幫手可以列出所有外送員送出的餐點次數和營收。
