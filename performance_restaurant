To understand more about the activity of restaurants on the platform, the manager must monitor the performance of every operation. 
To avoid the high price being confusing, managers point out that the information they would like to see is the number of orders rather than the profit. 
We would like to have you list every dish from every single restaurant. 
為了更了解餐廳在平台上的營業狀況，主管也在思考要不要看一下每間餐廳各餐點的銷售表現。
另外，為了避免單價比較高的餐點混淆，主管特別提出，他想要知道的是送出餐點的次數，而不是營收。
請列出各餐廳中，每個餐點所賣出的數量。
