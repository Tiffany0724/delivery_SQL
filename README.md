Our manager realized that our fast food and Chinese food are the most popular meals, and it represents an important percentage of profit. Thus, while tracking profit,  the manager took these meals as first priority. The supervisor checked whether the whole profit achieved our expectations so the total profit of these meals was selectively taken into consideration.

On all platforms, the courier is a key actor in creating a great experience to track the condition of the delivery. To fulfill different demands, I was able to list different conditions to query all collected information and develop strategies to solve preexisting issues:

Recently, one of our couriers Rider1 told our platform that there might be a mistake in the calculation of the fast-food commission. Therefore I was requested to elaborate a pathway that allows us to determine the commission by calculating the total profit first while helping the platform show Rider1 as the courier and also the restaurantâ€™s name. 

To keep the restaurant on the platform, the supervisor is needed to check the restaurants that are not doing well and should help them. Now they are able to see the profit of those restaurants making under 300 dollars from 2022-01-01 to 2022-01-03 to evaluate which restaurants need assistance.

To understand more about the activity of restaurants on the platform, the manager can now monitor the performance of every operation. 

To avoid the high price being confusing, managers can now filter the information they would like to see such as the number of orders rather than just the profit.

It is now possible as well to list every dish from every single restaurant after these changes.

During the operation, the platform communicates to restaurants about the performance of their dishes. So they needed someone to be able to count the dishes that have never been sold on the platform, a task which I fulfilled successfully.

After reviewing the performance of the restaurant, I provided a way to understand the performance of our couriers. Competition is stiff because there are lots of delivery platforms.
If the couriers cannot earn basic income, they will leave to another platform.

In order to understand the performance of couriers, a way to count the order amount and total income was needed. Therefore I helped to list every delivery person, their delivery time, and profit.

The supervisor is now able to create an award system to cheer couriers to stay on our platform since they would like to select the most outstanding one.

The standard of awarding is to select the most diligent delivery staff which finished the highest number of orders. So now they can select which dishes are delivered for each restaurant and make sure that the number on both sides (the delivery person and the restaurant) is the same.

We also wanted to have the option to distinguish the most accountable delivery staff for which I generated a system to compound the delivery time with the number of delivered orders.
