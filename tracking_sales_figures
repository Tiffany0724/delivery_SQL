Our manager realized that our fast food and Chinese food are the most popular meals, and it represents and important percentage of profit. 
Thus, while tracking profit, the manager takes these meals as first priority. The supervisor checked whether the whole profit achieved our expectations. 
Please, take into consideration the total profit of these meals. 
之前主管有發現，我們的速食和中餐是最暢銷的餐點，佔據一定比例的營收。因此我們在追蹤營收狀況時，會優先看這兩種類型的餐點，在這幾天的總營收有沒有達到我們預期的要求。
算出 merchant type 等於 fast food 或 chinese 總共的營收。
